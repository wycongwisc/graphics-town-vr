Three different behaviors that you made:
1. The two helicopters (one moving in a circle that is rideable, the other moving in a star shape) (Heli Scene*)
2. Forklift* (see below)
3. Dump Truck* (see below), fan* (rotates on x-axis)

One behavior that is not simple:
Not simple: Forklift* (carries the box to a location, lifts the box up so that it can be grabbed by the arm, lowers the lift after it has been grabbed and continues on)
