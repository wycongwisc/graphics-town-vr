Advanced Thing: Complex Behaviour (#2)
Birds use a state machine to decide if they should fly around aimlessly or land on a roof of a house, they will take off again if the roof is destroyed.

Advanced Thing: Complex Behaviour (#2)
Sand shader rolls sand into the water if there are no neighbors (doesn't work at diagonal corners, only on edges);

Advanced Thing: Complex Behaviour (#2)
Boats turn randomly and attempt to avoid hitting land with 3 "sensors" in front of them (there are a couple issues with this, namely they can't turn fast enough in certain situations)

Advanced Thing: Complex Behaviour (#2)
Building Placement: difficult to describe all the actions, but building pieces react to their neighbors presence/lack of and will adjust accordingly. Different building pieces can appear depending on configuration.

Advanced Thing: Animated Shader Effect (#5)
Water texture shifts vertices and colors depending on time-based sin wave

Advanced Thing: Key-Framing (#7)
Birds' wing movements are animated in blender using key-framed animation

Advanced Thing: Procedurally Generated Geometry (#11), Use Noise (#12)
Sand shape is generated based off of simplex noise (layered frequencies) and existance of neighbors (rolls off into water if no neighbors on side)

Advanced Thing: Other:
A couple other game features including:
- New camera system with new controls
- Raycasting to determine building direction
- Many "placement" mechanics
