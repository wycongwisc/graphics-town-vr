Three different behaviors that you made:
1. Boat No. 0* - Boats randomly turn left and right, and attempt to avoid hitting land (sometimes do if they have nowhere to go)
2. Bird No. 0* - Birds fly randomly until a roof is available and then they may choose to land on it (one bird per roof). (Simple state machine)
3. WaterBox <5, 5>* - Animated shader that imitates waves by adjusting height of cube vertices by a sin wave

One behavior that is not simple:
Not simple: Bird No. 0* - See description above
or: Sand and house placement system

Animated Articulated Figure:
Articulated: Bird No. 0* - Bird is animated (in Blender) and flaps 2-jointed wings (pieces rotate off preceding joints). Flap speed is relative to world speed as well
