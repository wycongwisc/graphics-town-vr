My town's theme is an Island Town Builder

There is not a good text box to describe this, but I have added a sort of "building game" on top of the framework

To access the controls, select the 'Game Camera' from the camera dropdown
The controls are:
 - Left mouse: add block
 - Right mouse: remove block
 - Middle mouse: rotate
 - Scroll: zoom
 - W,A,S,D: pan (make sure you're focused on the canvas window)

There are a bunch of behaviours coded in to allow consistency and you can make some pretty creative buildings and towns with it. I have placed some blocks manually as a demo scene to get started.
