1. What is the difference between a bump map and a normal map?

A bump map takes the "height", while a normal map changes the normals in XYZ space.

2. What is the difference between a "correct skybox" and simply putting a big cube around the world?

A "correct skybox" changes distance when the camera moves to make sure the illusion stays in place.

3. Why is a sphere a good object for environment mapping, but a flat square is less good?

A sphere is a good object for environment mapping because it reflects the image at more angles.

4. What are the main choices for how to represent environment map images? Why might you pick one or the other?

You can either represent it on a sphere or a cube map. Both have small sampling issues, but cube maps are nice because it is only one picture. Cube maps are nice for graphics hardware.
