            <p>For this assignment, the instructions and rubric are on the course web, not inside the workbook.</p>
<p><strong>Short version:</strong> Make a &ldquo;town&rdquo; in the world on the <a href="../../for_students/12-grtown.html" class="for_students">12-grtown.html</a> page in the workbook. Get points for making things. Document what you do on <a href="../../docs/3/">Page  3  (Graphics Town Text Boxes)</a>. If it&rsquo;s cool, you&rsquo;ll get a good grade.</p>
<p><strong>Why is there a long version?</strong> Students often want to know &ldquo;how much do I need to make?&rdquo; Or &ldquo;how cool does it have to be?&rdquo; But, we want to make things be flexible because students can be <strong>very</strong> creative, and we want to encourage that.</p>
<p>The hard part is quantifying “enough” and “cool”. We might say “you’ll know it when you see it.” But instead, we have to try to write something…</p>
<p>Note: the graphics town &ldquo;box&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t shown on this page - it is a separate html file: <a href="../../for_students/12-grtown.html" class="for_students">12-grtown.html</a>.</p>
<p>You can earn up to 70 basic points and 15 bonus points for transforming the simple scene with some random stuff in it into something else. (there were 15 (basic) points on <a href="../../docs/1/">Page  1  (Warmup: Fancy Texturing)</a>).</p>
<p>There are a bunch of pages explaining what you should do. There is an <a href="https://graphics.cs.wisc.edu/Courses/559-sp2021/grtown/">index page</a> which links to:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://graphics.cs.wisc.edu/Courses/559-sp2021/grtown/grtown/">The instructions (start with this)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://graphics.cs.wisc.edu/Courses/559-sp2021/grtown/rubric/">The rubric</a> - This is useful because it implies the things you should do.</li>
<li><a href="https://graphics.cs.wisc.edu/Courses/559-sp2021/grtown/hints/">Some hints</a> - This includes an explanation of some aspects of the framework, as well as some hints of students have asked about in the past.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember:</p>
<ol>
<li>You must document (in the textboxes on <a href="../../docs/3/">Page  3  (Graphics Town Text Boxes)</a>) what you do in order to get credit.</li>
<li>Add any files that you create to the repository.</li>
<li>Push early and often - it provides a backup in case something goes wrong.</li>
<li>Be aware of the collaboration policy (on the <a href="https://graphics.cs.wisc.edu/Courses/559-sp2021/grtown/grtown/#collaboration-use-re-use-and-attribution">instruction page</a>)</li>
<li>Keep the user interface on <a href="../../for_students/12-grtown.html" class="for_students">12-grtown.html</a> - you can add things to it, but we need the functions (like the &ldquo;grader&rdquo; button)</li>
<li>Complete the handin survey when you are done (and have pushed)</li>
</ol>
<p>Within the workbook, there is <a href="../../for_students/12-grtown.html" class="for_students">12-grtown.html</a> page and its associated <a href="../../for_students/12-grtown.js" class="for_students">12-grtown.js</a>. This is where your town goes. There is also an <code>examples</code> directory, which gives you some sample stuff to get started.</p>
<p>We have given you a basic &ldquo;world&rdquo; to start. It is really more of a collection of random objects than a &ldquo;town.&rdquo; You may use these objects in your town, but you should arrange things in a more meaningful manner. In fact, you should not use the <code>main</code> function that we provide as an example.</p>
<p>You need to highlight some of <strong>your</strong> objects. As an example, we have highlighted some of our objects - but you can only highlight objects that you created. Be sure to remove the highlighting of our objects.</p>
<p>The next page <a href="../../docs/3/">Page  3  (Graphics Town Text Boxes)</a> has a number of text boxes for you to fill to document what you have done.</p>
