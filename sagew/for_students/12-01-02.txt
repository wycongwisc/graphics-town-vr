1. What is the difference between a bump map and a normal map?

Bump map describes how much a fragment should appear to be raised or lowered based on their normal, additional calculation needed to calculate new normals
Normal map stores actual normal data in rgb -> xyz

2. What is the difference between a "correct skybox" and simply putting a big cube around the world?

If we are talking about actual objects here, then a "correct" skybox would have the actual objects at a far distance, and would appear slightly different when moving large distances.

3. Why is a sphere a good object for environment mapping, but a flat square is less good?

The environment map is rendered at a single position, so the normal must vary for us to get a greaty distinct point on the environment map.

4. What are the main choices for how to represent environment map images? Why might you pick one or the other?

Cube:
+Easy to render
-Could see seams (corners are further away too)

Sphere:
+No seams
+Easy to take spherical photos
-Harder to render
