Two kinds of objects created for this assignment:
1. Boat No. 0* - Boat modeled and texture painted in Blender
2. SandBox <-1, 0>* - One piece of sand floor that has geometry generated in shader (more on this later)

Five other kinds of objects that you created:
3. TreeDecoration <3, 0.5, 3>* - Tree modeled and painted in blender
4. WaterBox <5, 5>* - Water box with animated vertex shader and color
5. Bird No. 0 - Bird modeled, painted, and animated in blender with behaviour
6. ArchBox <-2, 1, 0> - Arch modeled and painted in blender
7. WindmillBox <-8, 3, 7> - Windmill modeled and painted in blender

(^ these last two cannot be highlight because of a restriction with the framework
that I did not have time to fix - dynamic object list)

At least on of each type of object:
Building/structure: ArchBox <-2, 1, 0> - Arch modeled and painted in blender
Vehicle: Boat No. 0* - Boat modeled and texture painted in Blender
Natural Element: TreeDecoration <3, 0.5, 3>* - Tree modeled and painted in blender

Object loaded from a model file:
Model: TreeDecoration <3, 0.5, 3>* - Tree modeled and painted in blender

An object with a shader that you wrote:
ShaderObj: SandBox <-1, 0>* - One piece of sand floor that has geometry generated in shader (more on this later)
